## üöÄ Purpose of the Archive

The files in this directory represent the evolutionary steps taken during the development of the **Document Summarizer** project. They include:
- Early prototypes and proof-of-concepts.
- Experimental code for testing new features.
- Legacy code that has been replaced or refactored in the final version.

While these files are no longer part of the active codebase, they provide valuable insights into the development process and serve as a reference for future improvements.
